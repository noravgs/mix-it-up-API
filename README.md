## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Cocktail rest API

This was a project were I had to used specific API data to render the information that I wanted to display to the user. I used filter and map JavaScript's methods in order to facilitate access to the API. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Having more time I would love to implement an option where the user can request ingredients to be sent to the phone while at the store and buy what you need to make the drink.

## Lessons Learned:

While working with the Cocktail rest API. I learned how to acces data with different JS methods that I was not familiar with. I also learned how to create a simple CSS card to display the cocktail information.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
